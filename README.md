# COMP 373 Project 3
Thomas Walsh and Brandon Moy

In class Professor Zewdie told us that our pattern implementations did not need to be on the Facility system so here are our examples of the observer and bridge patterns. The example can be found within their own designated folders. To test the bridge pattern, run the main method in "test.java" to test the observer pattern run the main method in "observerMain.java". 

Feel free to email either of us if you have any questions.
